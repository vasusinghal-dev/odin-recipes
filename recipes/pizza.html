    <h2>About it</h2>
    <p>Margherita pizza is a classic Neapolitan pizza featuring a thin, chewy crust topped with simple but vibrant ingredients: tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, and a drizzle of olive oil. This pizza celebrates the colors of the Italian flag with its red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil) toppings. Named after Queen Margherita of Savoy in 1889, this pizza remains a timeless favorite for its perfect balance of flavors and textures.</p>
    <p>What makes a great Margherita pizza is the quality of its few ingredients. San Marzano tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, and hand-torn basil leaves create magic when combined on a perfectly baked crust. While purists insist on wood-fired ovens, you can achieve excellent results at home with a pizza stone or steel. This pizza is ideal for weeknight dinners or entertaining, as it comes together quickly but always impresses.</p>
