    <h2>About it</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian comfort dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich meat or vegetable filling, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese. Traditional recipes often include a hearty ragù (slow-cooked meat sauce with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs), layered with velvety béchamel and gooey mozzarella or Parmesan cheese. When baked, the edges become crispy and golden, while the center stays tender and saucy. This hearty, crowd-pleasing meal is perfect for family dinners or gatherings, as it can be prepared ahead of time and reheated without losing flavor.</p>
    <p>While lasagna has deep roots in Italian cuisine, many variations exist worldwide. Vegetarian versions might use spinach, mushrooms, or roasted eggplant, while some recipes swap the pasta for zucchini or gluten-free noodles. In the U.S., a quicker "American-style" lasagna often features ricotta cheese instead of béchamel and pre-made marinara sauce for convenience. No matter the recipe, the key to great lasagna lies in balancing the layers—ensuring each bite has the perfect mix of pasta, sauce, cheese, and filling. Serve it with garlic bread and a fresh salad for a complete, satisfying meal.</p>
