    <h2>About it</h2>
    <p>Chocolate chip cookies are the quintessential American treat, invented by Ruth Wakefield in the 1930s. These buttery, chewy cookies with melty chocolate chunks are beloved for their perfect balance of crisp edges and soft centers. The secret to great chocolate chip cookies lies in the quality of ingredients and proper technique - creaming the butter and sugars properly, not overmixing the dough, and using a combination of chocolate chips and chunks for varied texture.</p>
    <p>While the classic version remains unbeatable, countless variations exist today. Some bakers add nuts (typically walnuts or pecans), others prefer using dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet, and some even sprinkle sea salt on top for a sweet-salty contrast. These cookies freeze beautifully, so you can always have dough ready to bake fresh cookies at a moment's notice. Perfect with a glass of milk or as an ice cream sandwich base!</p>
